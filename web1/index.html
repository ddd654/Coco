    e, and nothing particular to interest me
    on shore, I thought I would
    little or no money in my purssail about a little and see the watery part
    of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and
    regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
    the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever
    I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
    bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;

    and especially whenever
    my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
    principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
    methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
    get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
    With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
    quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they
    but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
    cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
